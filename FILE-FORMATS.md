    "spelling": "elephant",
    "meaning": "A large gray animal with big ears and a long trunk",
    "level": 6
  }
]
```

## üìë PDF Files (.pdf)

PDF processing is currently not supported directly. To use PDF files:

1. **Copy text from PDF** and paste into a .txt or .md file
2. **Use PDF to Text conversion** tools online
3. **Save as text** from your PDF reader

## üéØ Tips for Best Results

1. **Be consistent** with formatting within your file
2. **Use clear definitions** that kids can understand  
3. **Specify grade levels** when possible for better targeting
4. **Keep one word per line** for text files
5. **Use UTF-8 encoding** to avoid character issues

## üîß Automatic Processing

The app will automatically:
- Remove duplicate words
- Assign grade levels based on word complexity if not specified
- Generate basic definitions for words without them
- Show validation errors and warnings
- Cache uploaded words for offline use

## üö® Common Issues

**No words found**: Check that your format matches the examples above  
**Grade not recognized**: Use numbers 1-12 for grade levels  
**Definition missing**: The app will create basic definitions automatically  
**File won't upload**: Ensure file extension is .txt, .md, or .json

## üìà Grade Level Guidelines

- **Grade 6**: 3-8 letter words, common vocabulary
- **Grade 7**: 6-10 letter words, more complex concepts  
- **Grade 8**: 8+ letter words, advanced vocabulary

The app uses word length and complexity to automatically assign grades when not specified.
